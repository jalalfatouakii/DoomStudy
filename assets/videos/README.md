# Video Assets

Place your bundled video files here. Each video should be small-sized (recommended: < 5MB each).

## Category Structure

The app expects videos organized by category:
- `gameplay.mp4` - Gameplay videos (e.g., Subway Surfers)
- `satisfying.mp4` - Satisfying videos (e.g., cutting things, ASMR)
- `narrated.mp4` - Narrated movie clips
- `ambient.mp4` - Ambient/background videos
- `nature.mp4` - Nature scenes

You can add multiple videos per category by naming them:
- `gameplay1.mp4`, `gameplay2.mp4`, etc.
- Or use a single video per category: `gameplay.mp4`

The code will automatically detect and bundle all `.mp4` files in this directory.
